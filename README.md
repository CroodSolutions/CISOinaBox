## Don't Panic! üö®

Security does not have to be a difficult or intimidating topic. Whether you're a small to medium-sized organization looking to improve your security, a current CISO seeking to enhance your practices, or someone aspiring to become a CISO, this project is designed to guide you through the essential knowledge areas of cybersecurity and risk management.

## About This Project üéØ

This project is intended to organize the ideas, processes, and supporting templates and tools required to succeed as a new CISO. While it will have humble beginnings, we hope it will grow and evolve with engagement from the community over time.

The views expressed as part of this project are the views of the individual contributors and do not reflect the views of our employer(s) or any affiliated organization(s).

## Quick Start for SMBs üöÄ

If you are a small to medium-sized organization looking to improve your security, start with these basic steps:

- Make sure you have antivirus setup on all machines / properly enabled.
- Use MFA everywhere you can.
- Select strong and unique passwords (sometimes a password manager can help).
- Set all your systems and software to auto-update or implement a process to manage updates and patches.
- Talk to your employees about phishing and malware (basic awareness).
- Take a closer look at what is internet facing, and get help if you have things that concern you in this regard.
- If possible, have someone take a look at your cloud email (O365 or Gmail) settings and any firewalls or Wi-Fi configurations you may have.
- Be sure to back up your data and make sure you have backups in a secure, different location from your business.
