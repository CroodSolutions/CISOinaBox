# **Building and Maintaining a Business Continuity Plan: A CISO’s Strategy Guide**

## **Introduction**

A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is critical for maintaining operations during and after disruptive incidents such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, supply chain failures, or technology outages. For Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), business continuity is more than an IT function—it’s a strategic, cross-functional responsibility that ensures both digital and operational resilience. Modern organizations face threats (like ransomware and data breaches) that rank among the top risks to continuity, so integrating cybersecurity into continuity planning is essential. This guide provides practical processes and insights to help CISOs build and maintain a mature business continuity capability as part of a cybersecurity program, aligning with industry standards and organizational needs.

## **1\. Establishing the Foundation**

### **1.1 Define Business Continuity Objectives**

Begin by setting clear objectives for business continuity that align with the organization’s overall risk appetite and any regulatory requirements. This means ensuring the BCP’s goals match what level of disruption the business is willing to tolerate and comply with industry laws or guidelines. Define concrete Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) – the maximum acceptable downtime for critical functions – and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) – the maximum data loss (in time) acceptable for those functions. These targets should be determined for each essential business process and system based on a business impact analysis and stakeholder input. Additionally, identify which operations are most critical to prioritize for continuity (for example, cybersecurity monitoring, identity/access management systems, internal and customer communications, and core financial transactions). Emphasize protection of these key areas because their failure can cascade into broader business outage (e.g. without identity directory services, employees cannot access systems, or without communications channels, incident response is hampered). By clearly defining continuity objectives and priorities up front, the BCP will have a focused scope that supports enterprise resilience.

### **1.2 Assign Roles and Governance**

Establish formal governance for the business continuity program. Appoint a Business Continuity Plan coordinator or manager – this may reside in the Risk Management, Security, or IT organization – who will lead plan development and maintenance. Form a Business Continuity Steering Committee with cross-functional representation, including Security, IT, HR, Legal, Operations, facilities, and executive leadership. This committee provides oversight and helps ensure all parts of the business are engaged in continuity planning. Develop a BCP charter that defines the committee’s authority, decision-making criteria, and escalation paths during a crisis. Clearly assign roles such as incident managers, department continuity leads, and crisis communications leads. Define succession plans and alternates for each key role so that if primary personnel are unavailable, backups can step in. This governance structure ensures accountability and that continuity efforts are not siloed. It also elevates BCP as a formal program with management support. Ensure executives explicitly support the BCP governance; their backing will set the tone that continuity is an organizational priority, not just an IT project.

### **1.3 Integrate with Cybersecurity Programs**

Integrate the BCP with existing cybersecurity and IT resilience plans to avoid gaps or overlaps. The BCP should be tightly coupled with the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for IT infrastructure, the Cyber Incident Response (IR) plan for security events, and the Crisis Communications plan for stakeholder messaging. All these plans should work in concert when a disruptive incident occurs. For example, if a cyber incident like ransomware occurs, the incident response process should trigger BCP actions for maintaining critical business operations while IT works to restore systems. Identify specific dependencies between these areas: for instance, ensure the disaster recovery procedures for critical systems meet the business RTOs defined in the BCP. Make sure third-party services and suppliers that IT and security rely on are accounted for – for example, cloud providers, data center hosts, identity management services, incident response retainers, etc. The continuity plan should document these dependencies and include strategies if a provider is unavailable. Additionally, coordinate with physical Emergency/Facilities plans (for building evacuations or regional disasters) so that site-level continuity (often called continuity of operations or COOP) aligns with your BCP. By integrating cybersecurity and IT continuity efforts under the BCP umbrella, the organization can respond cohesively to incidents. As NIST recommends, continuity planners must coordinate with IT system owners to ensure business process recovery expectations align with actual IT recovery capabilities. This integration prevents disconnects (such as the business expecting a system up in 4 hours when IT’s DR plan needs 24 hours) and fosters a resilient, unified approach.

## **2\. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**

### **2.1 Conduct a BIA for All Business Units**

Perform a Business Impact Analysis across all business units to identify and prioritize what needs to be recovered after a disruption. In the BIA, work with each department to catalog their key processes, applications, and dependencies, and determine how an outage would affect the organization. Identify mission-critical processes (those whose loss would cause significant financial, operational, customer, or regulatory impact) and the systems and personnel required for those processes. Estimate the impact of different outage durations – e.g. what is the cost or consequence if a process is down for 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, etc. – in terms of lost revenue, extra expenses, legal penalties, reputational damage, and safety. This analysis helps quantify the pain points of downtime. A well-executed BIA should also help establish preliminary RTOs and RPOs by revealing how quickly each function must be restored and how much data loss can be tolerated. For example, the BIA might show that the order processing system must be back online within 4 hours to avoid significant revenue loss, whereas the marketing website could be down 2 days with minor impact. Document these findings and have business owners validate them. The BCP will be built on this foundation of knowing which business functions are highest priority. **Tip:** Ensure involvement from all critical areas (operations, finance, customer service, etc.) in the BIA; even smaller departments might have crucial tasks (like payroll or regulatory reporting) that need consideration. The BIA results will drive the rest of your continuity strategy, so invest the time to get accurate data.

### **2.2 Document Dependencies and Interconnectivity**

As part of the BIA, map out upstream and downstream dependencies for each critical business function. Upstream dependencies include vendors or suppliers that the business relies on (for example, a payroll service provider or a critical component supplier) – if they fail, your operations may be disrupted. Downstream dependencies are parties that rely on you (such as key customers or partners) – their needs may dictate your recovery priorities. Document internal interdependencies too: many business processes depend on shared services like IT infrastructure, networks, identity management, and communications. **Include cyber-related dependencies** in this mapping. For instance, identify if a process depends on the Active Directory or cloud Identity Provider for logins (most do), on the network firewall or VPN for remote access, on the SIEM for detecting incidents, or on a specific API integration with a third-party. These underpinning technologies (authentication systems, network connectivity, security monitoring tools, etc.) must be available to support continuity – losing them can cripple multiple processes. A thorough dependency map might highlight, for example, that your e-commerce operation depends on a payment gateway vendor and on internet connectivity through a specific ISP; or that your incident response capability depends on an external forensics firm and on your logging server being operational. Include these in the continuity plan. Moreover, ensure third-party continuity plans are verified: work with critical vendors to understand their BCP and DR capabilities, and ideally obtain their RTO/RPO commitments. If a vendor lacks a solid BCP, that represents a risk you may need to mitigate (perhaps with an alternate supplier). By documenting all these interconnections, you can better plan how to maintain or workaround them during an incident. This might involve establishing backup vendors, offline manual procedures if a system is down (e.g. using paper forms if a digital system fails), or contracts with alternate site providers. Comprehensive dependency analysis ensures no major element is overlooked in continuity planning.

### **2.3 Analyze and Prioritize**

Use the BIA data to classify business functions and applications into priority tiers for recovery. A common approach is to define tiers or categories such as: **Tier 1** – Critical (must be recovered very quickly, e.g. within 4 or 8 hours), **Tier 2** – Important (recovery within 24 hours), **Tier 3** – Normal (recover within 3 days or more), etc. This tiering helps focus resources on what must come back first. For example, systems supporting revenue generation or life safety might be Tier 1, whereas internal administrative systems might be Tier 3\. Clearly document the criteria for each tier (often based on allowable downtime and impact severity). This prioritization should also align with your risk register and enterprise risk management: incorporate the BIA results into the organizational risk register so that continuity risks are tracked and mitigated like other risks. For instance, if the BIA identified that a regional data center outage is a top threat, that risk and its treatment (like implementing a secondary site) should be logged in the risk register. Additionally, use the BIA scenarios and impact estimates to design tabletop exercises (see Section 4.1) – e.g. if a certain process was rated highly critical, simulate its disruption in an exercise to test the response. Prioritization also aids budgeting: it’s often too costly to make everything fully resilient, so investments should target Tier 1 functions first for stronger continuity measures (like high-availability systems or more frequent backups). By analyzing and ranking processes and systems, you ensure the BCP focuses effort where it truly matters. This disciplined prioritization is key to a risk-based continuity strategy, as emphasized in standards like ISO 22301 which integrate BIA findings into continuity requirements. In summary, not all business functions are equal – know which “crown jewels” to protect and restore first.

## **3\. Developing the Business Continuity Plan**

### **3.1 Create Functional Plans**

Develop department-level or function-specific continuity procedures based on the BIA findings. Each critical business unit should have a documented plan for how it will continue or resume operations during a disruption. These functional plans detail the **who, what, how, and where** for that department in a continuity scenario. For example, the customer service department’s plan might include steps to reroute calls to an alternate call center or have staff work from home if the main office is unavailable. Include **backup communication methods** in every plan – e.g. if email or primary phones are down, have phone tree contacts, personal phone lists, or an emergency SMS alert system to reach team members. Identify **manual workarounds** for key processes in case IT systems are unavailable. For instance, if the order management system is down, can orders be logged on paper forms or spreadsheets temporarily? Document those manual procedures and ensure staff know where to find the forms or data needed. (It’s wise to periodically practice these manual methods to make sure they’re feasible.) Plan for **alternate site operations** as needed: if a primary facility is inaccessible (due to fire, weather, etc.), can the department operate from another company site or a recovery location? If so, document the address and what needs to be available there (computers, internet, etc.), or if not, consider remote work arrangements. Each functional plan should list the critical applications and data that function uses and reference the IT recovery plan for those systems. It should also include key contacts, both internal and external (vendors, clients to notify if there’s an outage, etc.). Essentially, this is the “playbook” for a department during a continuity event. By developing these procedures in advance, each team knows how to react and keep essential work going when normal conditions are disrupted. These plans should be reviewed by the business owners and kept up to date with any process changes. When combined, the department plans form a comprehensive BCP for the organization.

### **3.2 Define Technology Recovery Plans**

Align the IT Disaster Recovery (DR) plan with the business continuity requirements identified in the BCP. This involves documenting technical restoration procedures for the organization’s core systems and infrastructure, with a focus on meeting the RTOs/RPOs for critical business functions. Coordinate with IT teams to ensure there are detailed **restoration runbooks** for key systems like directory services (e.g. Active Directory, which controls identity and access across the enterprise), network services (DNS, DHCP, VPN), critical applications, databases, and any cloud platforms in use. For each such system, the DR plan should specify backup locations of data, steps to rebuild or failover the system, and who is responsible for executing those steps. For example, the DR plan for Active Directory should include how to restore domain controllers from backups or promote secondary servers, since secure identity recovery is a **key factor in overall business recovery speed**. Likewise, ensure the DR plan covers endpoints like how to re-deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools or re-image machines if needed, since cybersecurity tools may need to be operational to safely resume business. Document recovery procedures for cloud services as well – e.g. how to bring up instances in an alternate region if the primary region is down, or how to switch to a secondary cloud provider if applicable. The **goal is to translate business needs into IT actions**: if the BCP says payroll must be up in X hours, the DR document for the payroll system should provide a method to achieve that (perhaps through database clustering or a hot-site failover). Additionally, ensure **data restoration** processes are well-defined (from backups, replicas, etc.) and consider sequence: some systems (like authentication, networking) must be restored before application systems. This prioritization should mirror the BCP’s priorities. Keep the technology recovery plans updated whenever there are system changes (new software, infrastructure upgrades, etc.). Regularly review them to verify that the procedures are still accurate and that recovery resources (like backup servers, spare hardware, or cloud capacity reservations) are in place. Effective DR planning, as guided by standards like **NIST SP 800-34**, encompasses preventive controls, multiple recovery strategies, and thorough documentation of procedures. Ultimately, having detailed, tested technical recovery plans that align to business continuity objectives ensures IT can deliver on the needs of the business during a crisis.

### **3.3 Address People and Processes**

A mature BCP must account for the people who execute it and the business processes that may need adjustment in a disruption. **Cross-train critical personnel** so that backup staff can perform vital tasks if primary staff are unavailable. This mitigates key-person risk. For example, ensure more than one IT administrator knows how to restore backups, and more than one finance person can run payroll. Cross-training and mentoring programs help retain institutional knowledge and keep it within the organization even if individuals leave or shift roles. Likewise, create **succession plans** for key leadership positions: identify who would take charge if the CISO, CIO, or other executives are incapacitated during an event. Document these interim authority lines in the continuity plan (often as part of a crisis management plan). During a major incident, having pre-designated alternates prevents confusion in decision-making. Next, establish robust **employee communication and accountability procedures**. Maintain an up-to-date emergency contact list for all staff and have an **employee notification system** (email blast, text alerts, phone tree, or a mass notification service) to quickly inform employees about a disruption and what they should do (e.g. not come to the office, switch to backup systems, etc.). Two-way communication is important – consider using tools that allow employees to respond with their status (often called wellness or safety checks) so you can confirm they are safe or need assistance. For example, after an earthquake or regional disaster, you might send a survey asking staff to reply “1” if safe or “2” if in need of help. Incorporate **employee well-being checks** in your plan for scenarios like natural disasters or pandemics – the continuity of operations is closely tied to the health and availability of your workforce. Also plan for human factors like **staff fatigue** in long-running incidents: rotate teams if needed, have contingency for critical roles (bringing in contractors or borrowing staff from other regions). Ensure the BCP addresses HR policies around emergencies (payroll continuity, crisis leave, etc.) and includes resources for employee support (like counseling after a traumatic event). By proactively addressing the people aspect – through training, succession planning, and communication – you build a resilient organizational culture that can carry out the continuity plans effectively when an incident strikes.

## **4\. Testing and Exercising**

### **4.1 Tabletop Exercises**

Regular testing is the only way to validate if your business continuity plans will work in practice. Start with **tabletop exercises**, which are discussion-based simulations of emergency scenarios. In a tabletop, relevant stakeholders gather (physically or virtually) and walk through a scripted incident scenario, talking through their actions as the scenario unfolds. Design scenarios that reflect the top risks identified in your BIA and risk assessment – for example, a widespread ransomware attack encrypting servers, a major data breach affecting customer data, a regional power outage or hurricane, a pandemic wave, etc. Develop a narrative for the exercise (often with incremental injects of new information) and see how participants respond. **Involve both executive leadership and technical responders in these exercises.** This is crucial – executives need practice making high-level decisions (like approving communications, expenditures, or declaring a disaster) and coordinating with external parties, while technical and operational teams practice their incident response and recovery steps. A good tabletop includes representatives from all key areas: IT, security, business units, communications, legal, HR, etc., reflecting the cross-functional nature of continuity events. During the exercise, encourage participants to follow the plans: reference the BCP, incident response plan, call lists, etc., as they would in real life. This helps identify if any instructions are missing or unclear. Tabletop exercises can reveal gaps – for instance, an exec might realize they weren’t aware of their role to approve messaging, or IT might realize backups were not tested. Use varying scenarios to test different aspects: one exercise might focus on cyber incident response (testing IR and BCP concurrently), another on facility loss (testing relocation and manual workarounds). Document everything that occurs or any questions raised. The value is in the discussion and learning that occurs, without the pressure of an actual outage. Conduct at least one full tabletop per year for each major scenario, or more frequently for high-risk scenarios. As noted in industry practice, even one well-run crisis simulation a year involving leadership can significantly improve readiness. Tabletop exercises build muscle memory, reinforce roles, and increase confidence that the organization can manage a crisis while maintaining critical operations.

### **4.2 Technical Recovery Tests**

In addition to discussion-based drills, perform **technical recovery tests** to verify that IT systems and data can actually be restored to meet continuity requirements. This can include **disaster recovery drills** such as: recovering servers from backups, failing over applications to a secondary data center or cloud region, switching network traffic to a backup link, or rebuilding a critical system from scratch on a clean environment to simulate a cyber recovery. These tests should exercise the technical runbooks documented in your DR plans. For example, test restoring the finance database from backup tapes or cloud snapshots and measure how long it takes – is it within the RTO? Also test **failover procedures** for high-availability systems: e.g. simulate the primary data center going down and ensure systems come up at the alternate site. If you use cloud infrastructure, test scenarios like region-wide outages (using chaos engineering or disaster recovery as code, if possible, to automate spinning up in alternate regions). Don’t neglect to test **security systems and identity systems** as part of continuity. For instance, practice recovering Active Directory in an isolated lab to ensure you can bring it back securely after a cyberattack (there are specialized procedures for AD recovery due to its complexity). Similarly, test that your logging/monitoring (SIEM) can be restored or that it has failover – during a security incident, you want logs intact. If you use endpoint security (EDR), test re-deploying it if endpoints or servers are rebuilt. **Include these elements in DR exercises** so that you aren’t flying blind on security during a real event. It’s also wise to simulate *cyber incident conditions* during recovery tests – for example, as Bryghtpath suggests, run a recovery drill where a ransomware attack has occurred, to see if your backup systems are properly segmented and if you can restore without re-infection. Track the results of all technical tests: actual recovery times achieved, any failures or errors, data integrity on restore, etc. If something fails (e.g. a backup was corrupted or a system didn’t come up correctly), treat it as a learning opportunity to fix the plan or infrastructure. Regular recovery testing – at least annually for critical systems, and whenever major changes occur – is essential for confidence in the BCP. According to industry observations, organizations that include identity and IT recovery in their continuity testing recover significantly faster from disruptions. These technical exercises give management assurance (through evidence) that the continuity capabilities on paper will work in reality when needed.

### **4.3 Post-Exercise Reviews**

After every test or actual incident, conduct a thorough **post-exercise (or post-incident) review**. Gather the participants soon after the event while memories are fresh. Document what went well and where there were challenges or gaps. For exercises, the facilitator should compile notes on each issue encountered (e.g. “database restore took 12 hours vs 4-hour RTO” or “call tree contact info was outdated for several people”). Solicit candid feedback from everyone – often the people in the trenches will have valuable insights like “we weren’t sure who had authority to declare a disaster” or “the manual workaround for order entry needs more PCs available.” Prioritize the findings and update the BCP, DR plans, and related documents accordingly. For example, if an exercise shows that a particular team was not aware of the plan, schedule additional training for them. If a step in the recovery plan was missed or miscommunicated, clarify it in the documentation. These reviews are part of a continuous improvement loop. Each test or incident essentially audits your program against reality, and the **lessons learned should be fed back in**. It’s useful to maintain a **tracking log of issues/improvements** – sometimes called an action register or continuity risk register – where each identified gap is assigned an owner and target resolution date. For instance, if you found that not all critical servers were being backed up, assign IT to implement backups for those and mark it in the log. Ensure management has visibility into these items so they can allocate resources if needed (e.g. purchasing more backup licenses or updating contracts). Incorporate lessons from real incidents especially – they provide the most authentic test. Many standards (like ISO 22301 and NIST CSF’s Recover function) emphasize **improvements (RC.IM)** as a critical part of the continuity lifecycle, meaning organizations must update plans based on past events and changing conditions. In practice, after-action reviews might result in changes such as adding new communication steps, adjusting RTOs, redesigning a process for resilience, or even identifying new risks to address. By diligently performing post-exercise and post-incident reviews, a CISO ensures the BCP remains a living document that evolves and gets stronger with each test. This continuous refinement greatly increases the chances of a smooth recovery when an actual crisis hits.

## **5\. Maintaining and Governing the BCP Program**

### **5.1 Annual Plan Reviews**

A Business Continuity Plan is not “set and forget” – it requires regular maintenance. **Review the entire BCP at least annually**. Start by revalidating the Business Impact Analysis: have there been changes in the business (new products, new locations, process changes) that alter what’s critical or the required RTO/RPO? Update the BIA data with any new assumptions or metrics. Next, review and refresh each department’s continuity plan and each IT recovery plan to incorporate changes from the past year (for example, if the company implemented a new ERP system or migrated to a different cloud provider, the BCP and DR documentation must reflect that). Confirm that contact lists (staff, vendors, emergency agencies) are up to date – people move roles or leave, phone numbers change, etc. All recovery procedures should be updated after any significant system changes or upgrades; coordinating this with change management processes helps (e.g. any time IT deploys a new critical system, they should trigger a BCP review). Revisit the RTOs/RPOs and see if they are still aligned with business needs and technology capabilities. Over time, business tolerance for downtime may decrease, or conversely budget constraints might make certain aggressive RTOs unrealistic – adjust as needed with leadership input. Ensure copies of the BCP (including emergency procedures and manuals) are stored in accessible, redundant locations (for instance, a secure cloud drive, an intranet, and perhaps printed in a secure off-site location) and that stakeholders know how to get them during an incident. Conduct a **management review of the BCP** yearly as well, where the program status, changes, and any risks are presented to senior executives for approval – this aligns with ISO 22301’s requirement for management involvement in BCMS reviews. Additionally, incorporate insights from any incidents or near-misses that occurred since the last update (e.g. maybe a minor outage revealed a gap – ensure the plan addresses it). By performing structured annual reviews (or more frequently if needed), you keep the continuity plans current and effective. Many organizations schedule these reviews around the same time as disaster recovery tests or as part of yearly audit cycles. The key is not to let the plan stagnate. An outdated BCP can be as bad as no BCP when a disaster strikes. Regular reviews and updates ensure the plan reflects the organization’s current state and preparedness level.

### **5.2 Metrics and Reporting**

Develop metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the readiness and effectiveness of your BCP program, and report these to stakeholders (executive leadership and the board) on a regular basis. Good metrics will help demonstrate program maturity and identify areas needing attention. Examples of BCP metrics include: **Coverage Metrics** – e.g. the percentage of Tier 1 (most critical) business processes that have fully documented and tested continuity plans. Ideally this should be 100% for the top tier. **Training Metrics** – e.g. the percentage of employees (or departments) who have received BCP training or participated in an exercise in the last year. This shows how prepared the workforce is. **Recovery Performance Metrics** – for example, the average time to recover critical systems during tests vs. their RTO targets, or the success rate of annual recovery tests (what proportion met objectives). Another useful metric: **Plan Update Frequency** – how many times the BCP (or departmental plans) have been reviewed/updated in the past year(indicating the plan is kept current). **Exercise Participation** – number of tabletop exercises conducted with all relevant departments and executives (many aim for at least one full exercise with execs per year). **Issue Closure** – percentage of identified BCP/DR issues from tests that have been resolved. For cybersecurity continuity specifically, you might track metrics like number of critical systems without recent backups, or compliance rates with backup RPO (e.g. “95% of backups achieve the targeted RPO of 24 hours or less”). For regulated industries, metrics might include audit findings related to continuity (aim for zero significant findings). When reporting, use dashboards or charts to make it clear – for instance, a dashboard showing continuity readiness by department, or trend lines of recovery time improvements. Automated BCM software often provides **real-time dashboards to monitor plan status and compliance**, which can feed your reports. Present these metrics to the board or risk committee periodically (quarterly or semiannually) as part of the overall cyber/operational risk update. This not only keeps leadership informed but also helps justify resources for the program by showing measurable progress or needs. For example, if the metric “critical applications tested in DR” is only 70%, that gap can support a request for more testing resources or budget to address weaknesses. Metrics provide a common language to discuss continuity readiness and drive accountability (departments know they are being measured). By tracking and reporting such KPIs and KRIs (Key Risk Indicators), the CISO can ensure business continuity remains visible at the highest levels and continuously improved.

### **5.3 Continuous Improvement**

Strive to mature the business continuity program through continuous improvement. This means treating the BCP as a living program that evolves with each new threat, each test, and each organizational change. Establish a mechanism to **incorporate post-incident lessons learned** (as discussed in 4.3) – for example, after a real disruption, schedule a follow-up project to address any weaknesses observed, and update plans accordingly. Monitor changes in the threat landscape and business environment: the rise of new cyber threats (like supply chain attacks on software), geopolitical risks, or emerging technologies (such as widespread cloud adoption) can all impact continuity planning. For instance, if ransomware attacks are increasingly targeting backups, you might improve your backup protections (offline copies, encryption) and update the BCP to reflect those controls. If climate change is increasing severe weather in a region where you have a data center, you might adjust your strategy to add another geographic site. **Keep an eye on external frameworks and standards updates** too; for example, NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework may release new guidance on recovery (CSF 2.0), or ISO might update the 223xx series – aligning with updated best practices can further strengthen your program. Encourage a culture of resilience by inviting feedback: employees might notice potential continuity issues in day-to-day operations; create channels for them to suggest improvements (for example, an annual survey about preparedness or a suggestion box for continuity ideas). Leverage audits and assessments – internal audit or third-party reviews of the BCP can provide independent recommendations for improvement. Many mature organizations conduct **periodic BCM program assessments or audits** to benchmark against standards and identify gaps. Use those results to drive enhancements. Continual improvement is a fundamental principle in standards like ISO 22301 and in maturity models – it means you never consider the job “finished.” Some organizations formalize this by adopting a **maturity model** (see Section 6\) and working towards higher levels of maturity in a phased way. Also, stay informed through industry groups, CISO peer forums, and continuity professional networks about new ideas and common pitfalls. In summary, don’t let the BCP program become static; regularly update it not just on a set schedule but in response to the changing risk environment and after every exercise or incident. Over time, this continuous improvement approach will lead to a very robust continuity capability that can adapt to whatever challenges come next.

## **6\. Maturity Levels and Organizational Scale**

**Business Continuity Program Maturity Levels:** Organizations typically progress through stages of maturity in their business continuity capabilities. Below is an illustrative maturity model with levels from initial to optimized, along with their focus and characteristics:

| Maturity Level | Focus | Key Characteristics |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Initial (Ad hoc)** | **Reactive** | No formal BCP program; continuity handled informally or on-the-fly. Plans are largely undocumented, and responses to incidents are improvised. The organization is unprepared and relies on heroic efforts of individuals. Downtime and losses can be significant in a disruption. |
| **Developing (Foundational)** | **Basic Preparedness** | BCP basics are being established. A Business Impact Analysis has been conducted to identify critical functions, and some plans or playbooks are documented for those areas. Recovery roles are defined (e.g. a BCP coordinator named). However, the plans may lack detail and not all departments are covered. Testing is minimal. The organization is moving from reactive to proactive but continuity plans need refinement. |
| **Managed (Operational)** | **Standardized** | A formal, documented BCP exists covering all critical business processes. Regular training and a testing schedule (e.g. annual drills) are in place. Metrics are tracked (such as recovery times achieved, training completion). The program adheres to recognized standards and has management buy-in. When disruptions occur, responses are coordinated and follow defined procedures, leading to more predictable recovery outcomes. |
| **Optimized (Strategic)** | **Integrated & Improving** | Continuity planning is embedded in the organization’s culture and governance. The BCP is aligned with enterprise risk management and change management processes (so any new project considers continuity from the start). The program undergoes continuous improvement – lessons from exercises and incidents are systematically used to update plans. Advanced strategies like automation of recovery steps and real-time monitoring dashboards are utilized. The organization is highly resilient, with a focus on not just recovering from disasters but maintaining continuous operations (built-in redundancy, failover, etc.). |

Many organizations perform self-assessments or audits to determine their current maturity level and then set goals (e.g. “achieve Managed level within 1 year”). Each level builds on the previous; for instance, you need a documented plan (Managed) before you can truly optimize and automate it (Optimized).

**BCP Guidance by Organization Size:** The approach to business continuity should be scaled to an organization’s size and complexity. Below are considerations for small, medium, and large organizations in implementing BCP:

| Org Size | Recommended BCP Focus |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Small (\< 500 users)** | Use a simplified BIA (“BIA-lite”) to identify just the essential processes and assets (since smaller businesses have fewer moving parts). Focus continuity efforts on high-impact areas and cloud services if used – leverage cloud infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service applications which often have built-in resilience so you don’t have to build everything in-house. Given limited IT staff, consider outsourcing some continuity and recovery capabilities to expert providers (for example, using a managed backup/DR service or consulting firm to help craft the DR plan). Testing can also be lighter weight – perhaps annual tabletop drills and basic restore tests – but make sure to do them. Small companies often lack dedicated continuity roles, so assign continuity responsibilities as part of someone’s role (e.g. IT manager doubles as BCP coordinator). Leverage flexibility – in a small firm, people can wear multiple hats in a crisis, but also ensure no single person is a single point of failure. Cloud-based tools and external support can allow even an SMB to achieve strong continuity capabilities on par with larger firms. |
| **Medium (500–5000 users)** | Establish a more formal cross-functional BCP team and governance structure. Medium organizations should have at least one dedicated or primary responsible person for continuity planning. Conduct full BIAs for all departments and develop a comprehensive BCP document. Implement regular training and **formal tabletop exercises** involving department heads and some executives – aim for at least one exercise per year that includes all business units. Also start evaluating **vendor continuity**: medium businesses often rely on many third-party providers, so perform vendor risk assessments focusing on business continuity (ask key vendors for their BCP/DR plans or audit reports) and consider those in your plans. At this size, use of technology like mass notification systems for crisis communications becomes feasible and recommended (to quickly alert hundreds or thousands of employees). Ensure backup solutions cover all critical data and consider geographically distributed recovery sites (e.g. a secondary office or a colocation data center) for IT disaster recovery. A medium org’s BCP should address more scenarios and have more detailed procedures, as operations are more complex than a small biz. It’s also important to gain management buy-in through periodic reporting on BCP readiness. Budget for business continuity in line with risk – medium enterprises should invest in areas like redundant internet links, backup power generators, etc., as appropriate. |
| **Large (\> 5000 users)** | Large enterprises need fully integrated and comprehensive continuity programs. This includes dedicated BCP/DR/CR (crisis response) teams, often separate but collaborating (or a formal resilience office). The BCP is likely aligned with multiple standards (ISO 22301, etc.) and subject to regular audits. **Real-time monitoring and dashboards** are commonly used – for example, a control center that shows system statuses, incident alerts, and recovery progress in real time for leadership. Automation is key at this scale: automate failover for critical systems, use orchestration tools to spin up recovery environments, automate notifications to thousands of employees, etc. Large organizations conduct frequent and varied tests: quarterly departmental drills, annual full-scale exercises (sometimes unannounced “surprise” drills), and simulations that include external partners or regulators. Another focus area is widespread **crisis communications** – having a robust plan to communicate with media, investors, regulators, and customers during a disruption (large firms often have significant reputational risk). Large enterprises also typically invest in alternate sites for operations (e.g. fully equipped recovery sites or multiple active-active data centers) to ensure continuity of essential functions with minimal downtime. They maintain extensive documentation (policy, standards, procedures) and training programs. The BCP at a large company is continually improved and is a part of enterprise risk strategy at the board level. Also, large organizations may implement **scenario-specific playbooks** (for example, a pandemic plan, a cyber breach plan, a regional blackout plan) under the umbrella of the BCP, given the breadth of their risk exposure. The expectation for a large org is that it can handle even severe crises through depth of resources and planning – but this requires ongoing commitment, funding, and executive support. |

In summary, smaller companies should focus on simplicity and external support for continuity, mid-sized companies formalize and broaden their programs, and large enterprises institutionalize continuity with advanced capabilities. Regardless of size, every organization can tailor continuity best practices to fit their needs – the key is to ensure appropriate measures are in place corresponding to the scale and impact of potential disruptions on the business.

## **Appendix A: Key BCP Deliverables**

When building and maintaining the business continuity program, the following deliverables and artifacts should be produced and kept up to date:

* **Business Impact Analysis (BIA) Report:** Documentation of the BIA process and results, including identified critical processes, impact estimates, and the RTO/RPO requirements for each process. This report underpins many other deliverables.

* **Business Continuity Policy:** A high-level policy document approved by executives that outlines the purpose, scope, and key principles of the business continuity program. It defines roles/responsibilities and mandates the development of plans and periodic testing (aligning with standards like ISO 22301’s policy requirements).

* **Department/Function Continuity Plans:** The detailed playbooks for each business unit or department on how to manage operations during disruptions. These include procedures, manual workarounds, contact lists, and recovery steps specific to the department.

* **IT Disaster Recovery Plans:** Technical recovery runbooks for critical IT systems and infrastructure. Each major system (applications, databases, networks, etc.) should have a DR plan detailing backup locations, step-by-step restore or failover instructions, and team assignments.

* **Crisis Management and Communication Plan:** (If not part of the main BCP) A plan that outlines how crises are assessed and managed at the leadership level, including stakeholder communication strategies (press releases templates, customer notice templates, etc.) and incident command structure.

* **Annual Test Results and After-Action Reports:** Documentation from each BCP or DR exercise (or real incident) summarizing what was tested, outcomes vs. objectives, issues identified, and improvement actions to be taken. Keeping a history of these reports demonstrates the progression and helps with audits and knowledge transfer.

* **Risk Register and Continuity Risk Assessments:** A register that captures continuity-related risks (e.g. single points of failure identified, gaps in plans) along with their mitigation status. Also, any formal risk assessment reports for continuity threats (like a site vulnerability assessment, supply chain risk analysis) should be maintained.

* **Executive Dashboards and KPI Reports:** The regular reports or dashboards presented to management showing the state of continuity preparedness (as discussed in section 5.2, including metrics like % of plans updated, test success rates, etc.). These might be monthly or quarterly snapshots used for governance oversight.

* **Emergency Contact Lists and Call Trees:** Up-to-date lists of key contacts (internally: leadership, response team members, and all staff; externally: vendors, emergency services, regulators, etc.) and communication trees for notifying people during an incident. These are often appended to plans for quick reference.

* **Alternate Site Agreements and Inventory:** If using an alternate recovery site or hot site, keep copies of the lease/service agreements and an inventory of equipment/resources available there.

* **Maintenance Log:** Some organizations keep a log of changes to the BCP and DR documents (version control) to track what was updated when and by whom, which is useful for accountability and audits.

Maintaining these deliverables current and readily accessible ensures the continuity program is comprehensive and actionable when needed. They also serve as evidence of the program’s maturity to regulators or other stakeholders.

## **Appendix B: Recommended Frameworks and Resources**

Various standards, frameworks, and industry resources are available to guide CISOs in building a robust business continuity and resilience program. Below is a list of key ones, each providing valuable best practices or requirements:

| Standard / Framework | Focus Area | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **NIST SP 800-34 Rev.1** | *Contingency Planning* | NIST’s “Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems” – a comprehensive guide on preparing IT contingency plans. It covers conducting a BIA, selecting recovery strategies, plan development, and testing. Though aimed at federal systems, it provides a rigorous approach applicable to any organization. This guide emphasizes aligning IT recovery with business needs and includes plan templates and step-by-step processes for different types of systems. |
| **ISO/IEC 22301:2019** | *Business Continuity Management* | The international standard for Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS). It specifies requirements to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, and continually improve a documented management system for business continuity. It’s a certifiable standard, meaning organizations can be audited and certified against it, which is useful for demonstrating resilience to partners/regulators. ISO 22301 provides a structured approach to governance, risk assessment (including BIA), business continuity strategies, and exercises. |
| **ISO/IEC 27031:2011** | *ICT Readiness* | An international standard providing guidelines for information and communication technology (ICT) readiness for business continuity. In essence, ISO 27031 is like a companion to 22301 focusing on IT/technical continuity. It describes how to plan and implement an ICT continuity management system (sometimes called IRBC – ICT Readiness for Business Continuity) to ensure an organization’s IT infrastructure and services are prepared for disruptions. It’s very useful for CISOs/IT DR planning, covering concepts such as aligning with business needs (it explicitly ties to ISO 22301’s requirements for IT). |
| **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) – *Recover* Function** | *Cybersecurity Resilience* | The NIST CSF is a widely-used framework for managing cybersecurity risk. Its **Recover** function (one of the five core functions) focuses on resilience and recovery planning. According to NIST, the Recover function involves developing and implementing appropriate activities to restore any capabilities or services impaired by cybersecurity incidents, and to maintain plans for resilience. It includes categories like Recovery Planning (RC.RP), Improvements (RC.IM), and Communications (RC.CO) which mirror BCP best practices (e.g., having recovery plans, incorporating lessons learned, and coordinating with stakeholders during recovery). The CSF Recover function aligns continuity efforts with cyber risk management and is a good bridge between IT-focused incident response and broader business continuity. |
| **FFIEC Business Continuity Management Handbook** | *Financial Sector Resilience* | The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) provides detailed guidance for banks and financial institutions on BCM. The FFIEC IT Examination Handbook on Business Continuity Management (most recently updated in 2019\) covers BCM from governance to BIA, risk assessment, resilience strategies, third-party management, testing, and cyber considerations. It’s considered a gold standard in the financial sector. Even for non-banks, its guidance is valuable – for example, it emphasizes involvement of the board in continuity, thorough testing, and integration of pandemic planning. It also addresses regulatory expectations. (In this guide above, several principles align with FFIEC guidance, such as involving third-party continuity plans and testing manual workarounds.) Financial CISOs should closely follow this handbook to meet examiners’ expectations. |
| **FEMA Continuity Guidance Circular (CGC)** | *Government/NGOs* | FEMA’s Continuity Guidance Circular (2018) is a resource designed to unify continuity planning across federal, state, local, tribal governments, and also applicable to the private sector. It details fundamental continuity principles and a framework for continuity plans/programs, including ensuring the performance of **essential functions** under all conditions. It covers establishing leadership succession, vital records management, communications, and human capital – key continuity pillars for government entities. Organizations can use the CGC to benchmark their continuity programs or to align with government best practices (e.g., for public-sector partnerships or if required by grant programs). FEMA also provides templates and the Federal Continuity Directives for federal agencies; while those are specific to government, they contain planning checklists that can be useful for any organization aiming for robust continuity capabilities. |

Each of these frameworks/resources can help a CISO strengthen different aspects of the BCP program. In practice, many organizations use a combination: for example, adopting ISO 22301 for a BCMS structure, using NIST SP 800-34 for detailed IT contingency planning guidance, leveraging NIST CSF to integrate with cybersecurity, and referring to sector-specific guides like FFIEC or FEMA for additional considerations. Keeping these resources at hand ensures the continuity strategy is informed by proven standards and can meet stakeholder expectations for resilience.
