Understanding the Adversary

How Cyber Attacks Work: Vectors and the Kill Chain
Common Attack Vectors: Most cyber attacks start with an attack vector – the path or method used to breach a system. Common attack vectors include phishing emails with malicious links or attachments, exploitation of unpatched software vulnerabilities, use of stolen or weak passwords, and insider misuse. For example, phishing is often the entry point for ransomware, while an unpatched server can be compromised by an exploit kit. No matter the method, attackers aim to bypass initial defenses by exploiting human error or technical weaknesses.
The Cyber Kill Chain: Security experts use the concept of a cyber kill chain to describe the typical stages of a sophisticated attack. Originally developed by Lockheed Martin, the kill chain breaks an attack into seven phases (eccouncil.org):
Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information on the target (e.g. researching employees, scanning the network for vulnerabilities).
Weaponization: The attacker creates or customizes malware or an exploit to use in the attack (for instance, crafting a malware-laced document or developing an exploit for a known vulnerability).
Delivery: The attacker transmits the weapon to the target environment. This could be via a phishing email, a malicious download, or other means (for example, sending a fraudulent email attachment or USB drop) (eccouncil.org).
Exploitation: The malicious code or exploit is triggered, taking advantage of a vulnerability to execute on the victim’s system (eccouncil.org). For instance, a user opening a booby-trapped file might enable the malware to run.
Installation: The malware installs a foothold like a backdoor or persistence mechanism on the victim’s system (eccouncil.org). This ensures the attacker can maintain access.
Command and Control (C2): The compromised system opens a communication channel (often to an external server) to receive instructions from the attacker (eccouncil.org). For example, the malware might connect to a C2 server to await commands.
Actions on Objectives: Finally, the attacker carries out their end goals – which could be stealing data, encrypting files (ransomware), disrupting services, etc. (eccouncil.org).
Cyber attacks may not always follow these steps linearly or include every stage, but the kill chain model is a useful framework for understanding how an adversary progresses. Importantly, it highlights that there are multiple points at which defenders can potentially detect or block the attack. Interrupting an attack at any stage of the kill chain can significantly reduce the damage. In fact, using the kill chain to deploy layered defenses helps organizations “understand, detect, and disrupt threats at each phase” (splunk.com). For example, strong email filters might thwart delivery, and up-to-date intrusion prevention systems might catch exploitation attempts, thereby breaking the chain before the attacker completes their objective. The earlier in the chain you can stop an attack, the less impact it will have (splunk.com).
Defensive Cybersecurity Strategies: Prevention, Detection, Response
Defending against cyber threats involves a multi-pronged approach often summarized as prevent, detect, and respond (to which many add a fourth phase: recover).
Prevention: These are measures put in place to stop attacks before they succeed. Prevention includes technical tools and policies such as firewalls, antivirus software, network segmentation, multi-factor authentication, and regular patching of systems. It also involves user awareness training and strong security policies to prevent human error. Effective prevention “extends the time it takes for attackers to breach your system” (avitgroup.com) – similar to a bank vault that delays criminals long enough for alarms to sound. However, no prevention is foolproof, which is why additional layers are crucial.
Detection: Since some attacks will inevitably bypass preventive defenses, organizations must rapidly detect suspicious activity or breaches. Detection involves continuous monitoring of networks and endpoints (using intrusion detection systems, logs, behavior analytics, etc.) and alerting on indicators of compromise. The faster an attack is detected, the faster it can be stopped. Modern strategies emphasize detection and monitoring just as much as prevention (avitgroup.com). For instance, an SMB might use a managed security service or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to spot signs of malware or unauthorized access that got past the firewall.
Response: Once an incident is detected, prompt incident response is vital to contain and eliminate the threat. Response procedures include isolating affected systems, removing malware, applying fixes, and communicating with stakeholders. Having an incident response plan and team (even if it’s an external partner for a small business) can dramatically reduce the impact of an attack. The goal is to mitigate damage, eradicate the attacker from systems, and restore operations as quickly as possible. As one cybersecurity firm puts it, focusing solely on prevention leaves gaps – robust defense must also include rapid detection and decisive response (avitgroup.com).
Recovery: (Although not explicitly asked, it’s worth noting.) After an incident, recovery involves restoring data from backups, repairing systems, and learning lessons to improve future defenses. For example, a local government may rebuild a compromised server and recover data, then implement new patches or training so the incident does not recur.
These stages are interconnected. Effective collective defense at an organization means balancing all three: prevention to reduce the attack surface, detection to catch anything that slips through, and response to neutralize incidents. In practice, SMBs and smaller agencies often operate with limited IT staff, so leveraging automated tools and managed services can help cover gaps in detection and response coverage. The rise of solutions like extended detection and response (XDR) reflects this need to integrate prevention, detection, and response in a cohesive way (avitgroup.com). Ultimately, the faster you can detect (D) and respond (R) to an intrusion relative to the time (P) it takes an attacker to break in, the better your outcome – as one formula puts it, security is effective if P > D + R (avitgroup.com).
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI): Staying Ahead of Threats
One way organizations can shift from a purely reactive stance to a proactive one is by leveraging cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Threat intelligence is the collection and analysis of information about current or emerging threats that could impact your organization (eccouncil.org). In essence, CTI is actionable knowledge about adversaries, their motives, their techniques, and indicators of their activity. It helps answer questions like: Who might attack us and why? What tactics or malware are they using lately? How can we recognize the warning signs of an attack?
What CTI Does: By studying threat data from many sources (past attacks, security research, law enforcement, etc.), analysts produce intelligence that helps organizations “make faster, more informed security decisions and change their behavior from reactive to proactive” (eccouncil.org). For example, if threat intelligence reports warn that a certain phishing campaign is targeting local governments this week, a city IT team can heighten alertness, update email filters, and remind staff how to spot the phishing lure – potentially preventing an incident. CTI thus enables defenders to anticipate attacks or at least mitigate them more effectively by knowing what to look for (eccouncil.org). Without such insight into attackers’ methods and vulnerabilities, organizations are essentially fighting blind.
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): A core element of CTI is identifying indicators of compromise. An IOC is a piece of forensic evidence that suggests a system may have been breached (picussecurity.com). These are like the fingerprints or traces an attacker leaves behind. Examples of IOCs include suspicious file hashes (unique identifiers of malicious files), IP addresses or domains that are known to be used by botnets or phishing sites, unusual login patterns, or specific artifacts in memory or logs. IOCs are extremely useful for detection – security tools and analysts watch for these indicators to catch attacks in progress or find affected machines. However, many basic IOCs (like malware file hashes or attacker IP addresses) can be changed by adversaries with relative ease. If you rely only on simple IOCs (say, blocking one malicious IP), a determined hacker can switch to a new IP or recompile their malware to evade signature-based detection (picussecurity.com). This leads to the need to also understand deeper patterns of adversary behavior.
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): TTPs refer to the tactics, techniques, and procedures that threat actors use – essentially their playbook or modus operandi. A tactic is a high-level goal or category of activity (e.g. “Credential Access” – stealing passwords), techniques are the specific methods used to achieve that (e.g. using a tool like Mimikatz to dump passwords from memory), and procedures are the detailed steps or implementations of a technique (exactly how a particular hacker runs Mimikatz, including any scripts or parameters) (splunk.com). Together, TTPs describe the behavior of threat actors in a structured way (splunk.com). Unlike simple IOCs, TTPs are harder for adversaries to change frequently, because they reflect skill sets, habits, or resources that the attacker develops over time (picussecurity.com). For instance, an attacker can easily generate a new file hash (rendering an IOC list outdated), but completely changing their tactics or tools – say, switching from Windows-based malware to Linux-based, or abandoning a successful phishing technique – is more costly and difficult. Thus, CTI that focuses on TTPs can yield more enduring insights. By analyzing TTPs, security teams can predict attack patterns and implement countermeasures accordingly (splunk.com). In fact, “understanding the TTPs involved in a cyberattack kill chain” allows defenders to discover and respond to threats proactively (splunk.com). For example, if intelligence reveals that a threat group often uses a specific tactic (like spear-phishing employees in finance to initiate fraudulent wire transfers), an organization can implement stricter verification processes for fund transfers and train that department accordingly.
Modern threat intelligence feeds and platforms often share both IOCs (for quick wins in detection) and higher-level TTP information. A popular community framework for cataloguing TTPs is the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, which enumerates adversary tactics and techniques observed in real incidents (picussecurity.com). MITRE ATT&CK provides a common language for describing attacks, listing dozens of techniques (from phishing to privilege escalation methods) organized under tactics, and even maps which threat groups have been known to use which techniques. This kind of structured intel helps defenders understand what a particular adversary might do next and ensure their defenses cover those possibilities.
In summary, CTI transforms raw data about threats into actionable guidance. It tells you which threats to worry about most, how those threats tend to operate (their tools and methods), and how to recognize or stop them. For resource-constrained SMBs or local governments, consuming threat intelligence from external sources (like an industry ISAC or a commercial feed) is invaluable – it’s like having an early warning system that alerts you to dangers others have already seen, so you don’t have to learn the hard way.
Tracking Adversaries: Using TTPs and Attribution
Cyber defenders not only react to individual incidents, but also try to answer “Who is behind these attacks?” and “Have we seen them before?”. Identifying and tracking threat actors (also called adversaries) allows security teams to attribute attacks to specific groups or individuals, which can be crucial for understanding the bigger picture and tailoring defenses.
Threat Actor Profiles: Over time, the security community has identified many hacking groups and documented their characteristics. Advanced threat actors (sometimes called Advanced Persistent Threats, or APTs) are often given codenames (e.g. APT28, Scattered Spider, FIN7, etc.) and linked to certain sectors or nations, though cybercriminal gangs are tracked as well. These profiles typically include the group’s suspected motives (financial crime, espionage, hacktivism), their known TTPs, tools or malware they favor, and past targets.
Attribution and TTPs: Attribution is the process of linking an incident to a likely perpetrator. This is a complex art, as attackers often try to hide their identity. Analysts use a combination of technical clues and intelligence: the malware code or tools used (do they resemble those used by a known group?), the attack infrastructure (servers, domains – are they previously tied to a group?), the tactics and behavior (do the techniques align with patterns seen from a certain actor?), and even contextual factors (is the target consistent with the actor’s interests?). Because many threat actors stick to a “toolkit” of tactics and procedures, these TTP patterns are a strong clue. In fact, frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK enable defenders to map the techniques observed in an incident and see which known groups use that combination. This doesn’t prove who did it, but it narrows the field. For instance, if an intrusion involves custom malware X and technique Y that only a couple of groups use, analysts can prioritize those groups in investigation. As a public example of adversary tracking, the MITRE ATT&CK database currently catalogs 133 threat groups with their associated tactics and techniques. Each group entry in ATT&CK shows which techniques that group has used and even visualizes them on a matrix. This helps incident responders quickly understand an adversary’s playbook.
It's important to note that formal attribution (especially to a nation-state) often requires evidence from law enforcement or intelligence agencies. Private-sector CTI teams focus more on “tracking” adversaries – grouping related attacks and tactics together – without always naming who is ultimately behind it. For a business or local government, the practical goal isn’t to publicly accuse a culprit, but to learn enough about the adversary to defend effectively. If you determine that the same actor (say, a ransomware gang) keeps targeting similar municipalities, you can share that information with peers and law enforcement, and use their known TTPs to fortify your systems. Tracking adversaries over time also helps measure risk: if you know a certain threat group targets your industry, you can prioritize defenses against the techniques that group favors. In sum, adversary tracking is an extension of threat intelligence that builds a narrative around who is attacking and how, enabling a more informed defense strategy.
Intelligence Sharing Among Organizations
No organization exists in isolation when it comes to cyber threats. Attackers often reuse the same tactics on many victims, so the defensive value of sharing warnings and lessons is enormous. Threat intelligence sharing is the practice of organizations exchanging information on cyber threats, incidents, and best practices. This can happen through formal groups or informal networks, and it’s a cornerstone of modern cyber defense.
ISACs and Trust Communities: One of the most structured ways to share cyber intelligence is via Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). ISACs are industry-specific groups, often non-profit, where members (companies or government agencies in a sector) pool their cyber threat data and insights. For example, banks collaborate through the Financial Services ISAC (FS-ISAC), and there is an MS-ISAC (Multi-State ISAC) dedicated to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments (health-isac.org). 
For SMBs and local governments that might lack full-fledged security teams, tapping into shared intelligence is often one of the most cost-effective security practices. It’s essentially leveraging the collective vigilance of many other organizations. As attackers increasingly strike a wide range of targets (including those traditionally less fortified), being connected to a larger intel community ensures you are not fighting alone. In fact, information sharing is a key pillar of collective cyber defense, as discussed next.
Collective Defense: The Power of Working Together
Collective defense is the overarching concept that “it takes a village” to fight sophisticated cyber adversaries. No single organization – especially a small one – can single-handedly stop all threats. Collective defense in cybersecurity means collaboration across organizations (and often between the public and private sectors) to jointly defend against threats through information sharing, coordinated responses, and mutual assistance (cyware.com). In other words, organizations form a community that treats an attack on one as a concern for all, operating under the principle
