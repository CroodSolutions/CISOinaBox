Don't Panic!!

Security does not have to be a difficult or intimidating topic.  

If you are a small to medium sized organization looking to improve your security, start with a few basic things:
 - Make sure you have antivirus setup on all machines / properly enabled.
 - Use MFA everywhere you can.
 - Select strong and unique passwords (sometimes a password manager can help).
 - Set all your systems and software to auto-update or implement a process to manage updates and patches.
 - Talk to your employees about phishing and malware (basic awareness).
 - Take a closer look at what is internet facing, and get help if you have things that concern you in this regard.
 - If possible, have someone take a look at your cloud email (O365 or gmail) settings and any firwalls or Wi-Fi configurations you may have.
 - Be sure to back up your data and make sure you have back ups in a secure, different location from your busienss.  

This repository is intended to provide a basic overview of key knowledge area of security, for those ready to move beyond the few bullet points above.
